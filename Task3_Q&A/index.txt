Context:
You have two tasks above (Task 1 & Task 2). Take tomorrow’s date as the original due date for
both tasks. There is a family emergency at your place due to which you won’t be able to meet
the due date of the above tasks for at least 3 more days. Task 1 is for a low-priority customer
who has not provided any go-live date to us. Task 2 is for a priority customer whose campaign
needs to go live in the next 2 days.
Note - You can only ask for an extension for 1 task from the above.
Task:
1. What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to
this.
2. How will you inform the 2 separate account managers of both customers about your
approach? Write an internal message informing Manoj (Account manager for Task 1) &
Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) about your respective approach.
3. How will you communicate the delay of additional 3 days to the customer? (Write an
email to the customer informing them about this).


Ans:
1. My approach to solving this issue would be to prioritize Task 2, as it is for a priority customer 
whose campaign needs to go live in the next 2 days. I would immediately inform the Account Manager for Task 1 
about the situation and request an extension of the due date. I would explain the situation to them and assure 
them that we will complete the task as soon as possible.

For Task 2, I would work closely with the Account Manager to determine the critical components of the 
campaign that need to go live in the next 2 days. I would prioritize completing those components first 
and then work on the remaining parts of the campaign as time allows. I would communicate regularly with 
the Account Manager to ensure that they are aware of the progress we are making and any potential issues 
that arise.

2. Internal Message to Manoj:
Dear Manoj,
I am writing to inform you that there will be a delay in completing Task 1 due to a family emergency.
We understand the importance of this task to your client and will complete it as soon as possible. 
Could you please let us know if an extension of the due date is possible?

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Divya Jain

Internal Message to Ravi:
Dear Ravi,

I am writing to inform you that there will be a delay in completing Task 2 due to a family emergency. 
We understand the urgency of this task and will prioritize completing the critical components of the 
campaign that need to go live in the next 2 days. We will keep you updated on our progress and any 
potential issues that arise.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Divya Jain

3. Email to the customer:
Dear {Customer Name},
I am writing to inform you that there will be a delay in completing the task you have assigned to us due to
a family emergency. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and want to assure you that we are 
working to complete the task as soon as possible.

We estimate that the delay will be approximately 3 more days. As Task 2 is time-sensitive, we will 
prioritize it and ensure that the critical components are completed within the original deadline. 
We will then focus on completing Task 1 as soon as possible.

We understand that this delay may impact your schedule, and we will do everything we can to minimize 
the impact. We will keep you updated on our progress and any potential issues that arise.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Divya Jain
